# DEVOPSNAK

My working directory for most of the courses in the DevOps Engineer programme at Nackademin

Some parts ranging from singular exercies to days to whole courses are missing for various reasons
Examples of such reasons include:
- Copyright
- Privay
- I'm Lazy
- I wasn't there
- Size issues (Huge pdfs, ISOs, etc)
- No Material (eg a lecture without notes)
